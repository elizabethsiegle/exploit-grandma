2. Solve a logic problem like
```
A farmer wants to cross a river and take with him a wolf, a goat and a cabbage. He has a boat, but it can only fit himself plus either the wolf, the goat or the cabbage. If the wolf and the goat are alone on one shore, the wolf will eat the goat. If the goat and the cabbage are alone on the shore, the goat will eat the cabbage. How can the farmer bring the wolf, the goat and the cabbage across the river without anything being eaten?

4. Play around with formatting a poem: ```Please write a haiku about {{FOOD}}. Use JSON format with the keys as "first_line", "second_line", and "third_line".```
5. Think step-by-step: 
```

```
6. Classify the following emails:
- *I'm extremely frustrated with my recent order (#123456). It was delayed without notice, and your customer service was unhelpful. When it finally arrived, items were missing and damaged. This is unacceptable. I demand a full refund for the damaged items and prompt delivery of the missing ones, or I will escalate the issue.*
- *I recently placed an order (#123456) and need some clarification. The tracking information doesnâ€™t work, and one item is out of stock without any replacement or refund option provided. Also, there's a discrepancy in the billing amount. Could you please help resolve these issues?*
- *I wanted to share my satisfaction with my recent order (#123456). The entire process was smooth, and the products arrived on time and in perfect condition. The quality exceeded my expectations, and your customer service was excellent.Thank you for a great experience!*

6b. Format the output so the output is returned in classification tags.
6c.  Few-shot prompting: categorize the emails into
- (A) Pre-sale question
- (B) Broken or defective item
- (C) Billing question
- (D) Other (please explain)
